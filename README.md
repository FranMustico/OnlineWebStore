The online shopping website simulator program is a tool designed to give users an experience of online shopping. The program is structured around three main classes: Customer, Product, and Shopping Cart.

The Customer class contains the personal information of the user, such as name, address, and credit details. The class includes functions to modify personal information and display the current account information.

The Product class contains the information on available products for purchase. The program reads the information from a txt file and stores it in an array of objects. Each product has a name and a price. The class includes a function to display the available products to the user.

The Shopping Cart class allows users to add products to their cart and purchase them. The class has functions to add products to the cart, display the current items in the cart, and pay for the items in the cart.

Once the program is run, the user is presented with a menu of seven options:

Modify account information - allows the user to change their personal information
Show personal information - displays the user's personal information
Show available products - displays the available products for purchase
Add products to shopping cart - allows the user to add products to their shopping cart
See current shopping cart items - displays the current items in the shopping cart
Pay shopping cart - allows the user to pay for the items in the shopping cart
Exit - exits the program
The program is interactive, allowing the user to select the desired option and navigate through the program. The Shopping Cart class functions interact with the Product class to ensure the correct products are added to the cart and the correct prices are displayed. Additionally, the Customer class functions ensure that the user's personal information is accurate and up-to-date.

Overall, this program provides users with an enjoyable and realistic experience of online shopping while demonstrating how different classes can interact with each other to create a functioning program.

I have included a diagram with the classes and functions within the repository to better understand the funcitonallity of the program. The file is called "Final.drawio.pdf"
